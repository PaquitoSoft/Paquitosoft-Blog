This is the blog system I'm developing for my own website.
It's developed usgin several Node libraries.

Libraries
---------

These are the awesome libraries I'm using:

* [Express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) -- Sinatra inspired web development framework for node.js
* [Mongoose](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose) -- MongoDB utility library with ORM-like functionality 
* [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade) -- Robust, elegant, feature rich template engine for nodejs
* [Loggly](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-loggly) -- A client implementation for Loggly (cloud logging) in node.js
* [gravatar](https://github.com/emerleite/node-gravatar) -- Node.JS library to generate gravatar URLs

Express modules
---------------

As Express popularity is growing fast, there are a lot of modules to help 
using this amazing framework (based on [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect)).

Beyond the ones provided by Express, these are the ones I'm using:

* [connect-gzip](https://github.com/nateps/connect-gzip) -- Gzip middleware for node.js Connect and Express
* [connect-assetmanager](https://github.com/mape/connect-assetmanager) -- Middleware for Connect (node.js) for handling your static assets

Tools
-----

* [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) -- Monitor for any changes in your node.js application and automatically restart the server - perfect for development
