* [Mongoose](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose) -- MongoDB utility library with ORM-like functionality 
* [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade) -- Robust, elegant, feature rich template engine for nodejs
* [Loggly](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-loggly) -- A client implementation for Loggly (cloud logging) in node.js
* [gravatar](https://github.com/emerleite/node-gravatar) -- Node.JS library to generate gravatar URLs

Express modules
---------------

As Express popularity is growing fast, there are a lot of modules to help 
using this amazing framework (based on [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect)).

Beyond the ones provided by Express, these are the ones I'm using:

* [connect-gzip]()
* [connect-assetmanager]()
